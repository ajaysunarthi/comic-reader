**_Comic-Reader_**

I like _Cyanide & Happiness comics_. I have a folder, which contains **50-60 sub-folders**. Each sub-folder have _multiple comics_ in _image formats_.

It becomes cumbersome to switch between folders. And then again open image viewer to view the comic.

I have decided to view comics in browser itself. So, I have used node to server folders in the images directory. 

_User can browse comics using Left-Right arrow keys. Pressing the enter will take you back to root location.
And when you are already at root. Pressing or click can take you to the desired location's first position(image)_
